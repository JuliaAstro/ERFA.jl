All rights reserved.

This library is derived, with permission, from the International
Astronomical Union's "Standards of Fundamental Astronomy" library,
available from http://www.iausofa.org.

The ERFA version is intended to retain identical
functionality to the SOFA library, but made distinct through
different function and file names, as set out in the SOFA license
conditions. The SOFA original has a role as a reference standard
for the IAU and IERS, and consequently redistribution is permitted only
in its unaltered state. The ERFA version is not subject to this
restriction and therefore can be included in distributions which do not
support the concept of "read only" software.

Although the intent is to replicate the SOFA API (other than replacement of
prefix names) and results (with the exception of bugs; any that are
discovered will be fixed), SOFA is not responsible for any errors found
in this version of the library.

If you wish to acknowledge the SOFA heritage, please acknowledge that
you are using a library derived from SOFA, rather than SOFA itself.
