    c2ibpn(date1, date2, rbpn)

Form the celestial-to-intermediate matrix for a given date given
the bias-precession-nutation matrix.  IAU 2000.

### Given ###

- `date1`, `date2`: TT as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 1)
- `rbpn`: Celestial-to-true matrix (Note 2)

### Returned ###

- `rc2i`: Celestial-to-intermediate matrix (Note 3)

### Notes ###

1. The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
   convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
   JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
   among others:

   | `date1`   |     `date2` |                    |
   |:----------|:------------|:-------------------|
   | 2450123.7 |         0.0 | JD method          |
   | 2451545.0 |     -1421.3 | J2000 method       |
   | 2400000.5 |     50123.2 | MJD method         |
   | 2450123.5 |         0.2 | date & time method |

   The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
   cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
   is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
   the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
   optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
   are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.

2. The matrix rbpn transforms vectors from GCRS to true equator (and
   CIO or equinox) of date.  Only the CIP (bottom row) is used.

3. The matrix rc2i is the first stage in the transformation from
   celestial to terrestrial coordinates:

      [TRS] = RPOM * R_3(ERA) * rc2i * [CRS]

            = RC2T * [CRS]

   where [CRS] is a vector in the Geocentric Celestial Reference
   System and [TRS] is a vector in the International Terrestrial
   Reference System (see IERS Conventions 2003), ERA is the Earth
   Rotation Angle and RPOM is the polar motion matrix.

4. Although its name does not include "00", This function is in fact
   specific to the IAU 2000 models.

1. The algorithm used is valid from -4800 March 1, but this

2. The Julian Date is returned in two pieces, in the usual ERFA
   manner, which is designed to preserve time resolution.  The
   Julian Date is available as a single number by adding djm0 and
   djm.

3. In early eras the conversion is from the "Proleptic Gregorian

   the Gregorian Calendar, nor is the AD/BC numbering convention
   observed.

- `era`: Earth rotation angle (radians)

- `rc2t`: Celestial-to-terrestrial matrix

### Notes ###

1. This function constructs the rotation matrix that transforms
   vectors in the celestial system into vectors in the terrestrial
   system.  It does so starting from precomputed components, namely
   the matrix which rotates from celestial coordinates to the
   intermediate frame, the Earth rotation angle and the polar motion
   matrix.  One use of the present function is when generating a
   series of celestial-to-terrestrial matrices where only the Earth
   Rotation Angle changes, avoiding the considerable overhead of
   recomputing the precession-nutation more often than necessary to
   achieve given accuracy objectives.

2. The relationship between the arguments is as follows:

      [TRS] = RPOM * R_3(ERA) * rc2i * [CRS]

            = rc2t * [CRS]

   where [CRS] is a vector in the Geocentric Celestial Reference

   argument lies in the range 0 to 1, or vice versa.

2. The Celestial Intermediate Pole coordinates are the x,y
   components of the unit vector in the Geocentric Celestial
   Reference System.

3. The arguments xp and yp are the coordinates (in radians) of the
   Celestial Intermediate Pole with respect to the International
   Terrestrial Reference System (see IERS Conventions 2003),
   measured along the meridians to 0 and 90 deg west respectively.

4. The matrix rc2t transforms from celestial to terrestrial
   coordinates:

      [TRS] = RPOM * R_3(ERA) * RC2I * [CRS]

            = rc2t * [CRS]

   where [CRS] is a vector in the Geocentric Celestial Reference
   System and [TRS] is a vector in the International Terrestrial
   Reference System (see IERS Conventions 2003), ERA is the Earth
   Rotation Angle and RPOM is the polar motion matrix.

5. Although its name does not include "00", This function is in fact
   specific to the IAU 2000 models.

### Returned ###

- `rc2i`: Celestial-to-intermediate matrix (Note 2)

### Notes ###

1. The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
   convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
   JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
   among others:

   | `date1`   |     `date2` |                    |
   |:----------|:------------|:-------------------|
   | 2450123.7 |         0.0 | JD method          |
   | 2451545.0 |     -1421.3 | J2000 method       |
   | 2400000.5 |     50123.2 | MJD method         |
   | 2450123.5 |         0.2 | date & time method |

   The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
   cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
   is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
   the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
   optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
   are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.

2. The matrix rc2i is the first stage in the transformation from
   celestial to terrestrial coordinates:

      [TRS]  =  RPOM * R_3(ERA) * rc2i * [CRS]

             =  rc2t * [CRS]

   where [CRS] is a vector in the Geocentric Celestial Reference
   System and [TRS] is a vector in the International Terrestrial
   Reference System (see IERS Conventions 2003), ERA is the Earth
   Rotation Angle and RPOM is the polar motion matrix.

3. A faster, but slightly less accurate result (about 1 mas), can be
   obtained by using instead the eraC2i00b function.
